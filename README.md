# Real Time Object Measurement 

_Sample video to be inserted_

Learn how to perform object measurement using OpenCV and Python. We will use an A4 paper as our guide and find the width and height of objects placed in this region.

### How to run the script:

* Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You can check this by running python --version and pip --version in your command line.


* Download or clone the repository containing the Python script and the requirements.txt file.


* Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script and requirements.txt file.


* Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary packages listed in the requirements.txt file.


* Once the packages are installed, you can run the script by using the command python main.py where main.py is the name of the script you want to run.


* If the script runs successfully, it should execute as intended.


### Note

* requirements.txt file is a simple text file that lists all of the packages that your script depends on, along with their versions.


* Using a virtual environment is a good practice to avoid conflicts with other python packages on your system.


* You can create virtual environment and install packages by running python -m venv env and then source env/bin/activate for Linux and Mac or env\Scripts\activate for Windows and then pip install -r requirements.txt
